## Component System

The website uses a modular component system for consistent design and easy maintenance:

### Product Page Components

1. **Product Feature Grid**: Displays feature cards in a grid layout
2. **Product Code Example**: Shows code examples with syntax highlighting
3. **Product Applications**: Displays application/use case cards
4. **Product Benefits List**: Lists product benefits with highlights
5. **Product Visual**: Displays product diagrams/images
6. **Product Section Container**: Provides consistent section formatting

See [Product Components Documentation](docs/product-components.md) for complete usage details.

### SCSS Architecture

The SCSS is organized in a structured hierarchy:

- `assets/css/style.scss`: Main SCSS file (imports only)
- `assets/css/_base/`: Core styling (variables, typography, utilities)
- `assets/css/_components/`: Component-specific styles
- `assets/css/pages/`: Page-specific styles

See [SCSS Structure Documentation](docs/scss-structure.md) for details on the styling architecture.

## Data-Driven Approach

Product pages use YAML data files in the `_data` directory:

```yaml
# Example: _data/product_name.yml
title: "Product Name"
description: "Product description"

features:
  section_title: "Features"
  section_description: "Feature description"
  items:
    - title: "Feature 1"
      description: "Description"
      list_items:
        - "Item 1"
        - "Item 2"
    # More features...
```
