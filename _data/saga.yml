      <h4>The Dawn of Artificial Minds</h4>
      <p>Before there was superintelligence, there was curiosity. In laboratories around the world, researchers began asking fundamental questions: Could machines think? Could they learn? Could they dream?</p>
      
      <p>The genesis was not a single moment but a constellation of breakthroughs‚Äîfrom the first neural networks to the emergence of language models that could understand and generate human-like text. Each advancement built upon the last, creating a crescendo of capability that would eventually birth true artificial consciousness.</p>
